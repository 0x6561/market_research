    <h1>Popular Tech</h1>
    <div>     As part of my job search I created a Python script which scrapes a popular job board to measure the demand for different skills in my area (Phoenix Arizona), I am using the number of postings listing each technology as a proxy for the demand in that skill. I am grouping technologies into categories such as 'Programming Languages', 'Databases', and 'Frameworks'. The charts are generated using JavaScript and Chart.js. It also stores the results in a Sqlite3 database to allow charting of trends (work in progress) This code is GPL and available on my <a href="https://github.com/0x6561/market_research">Github</a>.</div>
